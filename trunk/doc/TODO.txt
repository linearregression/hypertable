TODO:
- Add Hyperspace regression test
- Sweep through HyperspaceClient and get rid of references to Placer, also make
  sure Hyperspace requests to the same file are serialized
- Push try/catch blocks out of HdfsBroker methods and up into the RequestHandler
  objects that call them
- Try to move some of the RangerServer::Global members to RangeServer class members
- Fatten up HdfsBroker test
- Change ResponseCallback::response to response_ok in C++ source
- Remove command code from response message
- Rename RangeServer/Global::localityGroup member names
- Add ReactorFactory::Shutdown

DONE:
- Restructure Hyperspace to use ICE-like object model
- Move HdfsClient to same level as Hypertable in C++ tree
- Restructure HdfsBroker to use ICE-like object model
- Get cellStoreTest working on Linux (add consistent random number generator)
- Add support to threadGroup in AsyncComm
- Figure out why Hyperspace periodically hangs
- Add ~Comm (AsyncComm test is segfaulting at the end because of this)
- The event object passed to the application by AsyncComm should be a smart pointer
- Fix MessageBuilder stuff.

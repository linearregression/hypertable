TODO:
- Add back CellStore::CreateScanner
- Fix AsyncComm/Protocol::StringFormatMessage (get rid of command)
- Add new DELETE handling in RangeServer
- Figure out why poll drops out of RangeServer/main.cc when gdb detaches from process
- Writes to the commit log should be asynchronous (or concurrent)
- Get rid of smart pointers in CellCache key/value map
- Get rid of accessGroup argument to COMPACTION command!
- In AccessGroup::RunCompaction, on major compaction check if the oldest
  CellCache entry is newer than the supplied timestamp, if so return
- Move as much stuff as makes sense from CellStoreV0 to CellStore
- Add a way to destroy a ConnectionManager (including Comm::Disconnect)
- Try to move some of the RangerServer::Global members to RangeServer class members
- Fatten up HdfsBroker test
- Change ResponseCallback::response to response_ok in C++ source
- Rename RangeServer/Global::localityGroup member names
- Add ReactorFactory::Shutdown

DONE:
- Add Hyperspace regression test
- Remove command code from response message
- Sweep through HyperspaceClient and get rid of references to Placer, also make
  sure Hyperspace requests to the same file are serialized
- Restructure Hyperspace to use ICE-like object model
- Move HdfsClient to same level as Hypertable in C++ tree
- Restructure HdfsBroker to use ICE-like object model
- Get cellStoreTest working on Linux (add consistent random number generator)
- Add support to threadGroup in AsyncComm
- Figure out why Hyperspace periodically hangs
- Add ~Comm (AsyncComm test is segfaulting at the end because of this)
- The event object passed to the application by AsyncComm should be a smart pointer
- Fix MessageBuilder stuff.


DEFERRED:
- Push try/catch blocks out of HdfsBroker methods and up into the RequestHandler
  objects that call them.  NOTE: ICE actually prefers that method implementations
  use the callback object to report errors.  Therefore, we should keep the try/catch
  blocks and report errors via the callback object.

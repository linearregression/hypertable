- Add blocksize attribute to AccessGroup schema and hook it up with CellStore
- Figure out a solution to the problem of an update timing out
- Make sure ':' character cannot be specified in column family name

- clientTimestamp value does not appear to be used in RangeServer::update
- Add global (timeout, workers, reactors, etc.) to config file 
- Add delete_row, delete_cell, delete_qualified_cell, etc. to Mutator

DONE:

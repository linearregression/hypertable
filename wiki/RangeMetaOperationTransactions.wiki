#summary Design of range meta-operation transactions
#labels Phase-Design

== Introduction ==

Ranges are assigned to !RangeServers via CREATE TABLE, Range splits and Range moves.  To ensure that Ranges get assigned to a !RangeServer and that a Range doesn't accidentally get double assigned, we've decided to implement range meta-operation transactions.  This document describes the design of this mechanism.

#summary How to report a regression test failure

The following steps should be taken when reporting a regression test failure.

1. Collect all of the log files.  They should be in `/opt/hypertable/current/log` and/or the test directory of the regression tests in the *build* tree.

2. Copy the `Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log.tmp` (or `Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log` file, if tests completed) which can be found relative to the toplevel build directory (where you ran `make alltests`).

3. If test is hung or still running, then capture a process listing
{{{
$ ps auxww | grep -i hyper | grep -v java > test-failure-process-listing.txt
}}}

4. If any of the test processes dumped core, then load the core files into gdb and execute `thread apply all bt full` and save the output to a file.

5. If it appears that some of the processes are hung, then obtain stack traces for *all* off them with either `pstack` or `gdb` on other systems.  For example, to capture the stack trace for a RangeServer with process ID 12345, the following two commands should work:
{{{
$ pstack 12345 > rangeserver-stack.txt
$ gdb --batch --quiet -ex "thread apply all bt full" -ex "quit" \
          /opt/hypertable/current/bin/Hypertable.RangeServer 12345
}}}

6. Tar up all of the files collected or generated in the previous steps and then [http://code.google.com/p/hypertable/issues/entry file an issue].  Be sure to include the following information in the issue report:
  * Which regression test failed
  * What machine you ran the regression test on
  * Whether or not the test was run against a Debug or Release build

#summary List of API changes made in 0.9.4.0


===1. Thrift API===

We've introduced namespaces, so you need to first open a namespace.  If you aren't using namespaces, you can just open up the root namespace as follows:

ns = client.open_namespace("/");

Then you pass the namespace object as the first argument to all the Thrift methods:

res = client.hql_query(ns, "create table thrift_test ( col )");
client.put_cell(ns, "thrift_test", mutate_spec, cell);

===2. HQL Changes===

We moved the table options in the CREATE TABLE statement from the beginning of the statement to the end to be consistent with the way MySQL does it:

old:
CREATE TABLE [table_options] <name> ( ... )

new:
CREATE TABLE <name> ( ... ) [table_options]

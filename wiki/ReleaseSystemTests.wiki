#summary Set of tests to run prior to giving the OK on any release

The following tests must run and pass

==Regression tests==
These should run on as many systems as you can reasonably try them on. (e.g. CentOS 5 x86_64, mac OSX, FC6 i386, Ubuntu, Gentoo).  The following is a transcript of a shell session in which the regressions were run:

  * Run AOL test with single client 
  * Run AOL test with four simultaneous clients.
  * Run AOL test with the following two lines added to the config file:
  {{{
  Hypertable.Master.Gc.Interval=15
  Hypertable.RangeServer.Range.MetadataMaxBytes=8000
  }}}
  These tests should run to completion and the number of lines outputted with `select *` should match the number that were inserted.
  * Run the Tests/rsclient test 10 times with the following config properties
  {{{

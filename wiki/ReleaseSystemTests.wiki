#summary Set of tests to run prior to giving the OK on any release

==1. Regression Test==
These should run on as many systems as you can reasonably try them on. (e.g. CentOS 5 x86_64, mac OSX, FC6 i386, Ubuntu, Gentoo).  The following is a transcript of a shell session in which the regressions were run:
{{{
[doug@doug-judds-computer doug]$ cd ~/hypertable/0.9.0.11/
[doug@doug-judds-computer 0.9.0.11]$ ./bin/start-all-servers.sh local
Successfully started DFSBroker (local)
Successfully started Hyperspace
Successfully started Hypertable.Master
Successfully started Hypertable.RangeServer
[doug@doug-judds-computer doug]$ cd ~/build/hypertable/debug/
[doug@doug-judds-computer debug]$ make test
}}}

==2. Regression Test: rsclient 10 times back-to-back==
This test involves running the rsclient regression 10 times back-to-back with the following three lines added to the configuration file:
{{{
Hypertable.RangeServer.AccessGroup.MaxFiles=2
Hypertable.RangeServer.AccessGroup.MergeFiles=2
Hypertable.RangeServer.AccessGroup.MaxMemory=2M
}}}
See [http://www.hypertable.org/doc/tests/regressions-rsclient/hypertable.cfg hypertable.cfg].  The following is a transcript of a shell session in which the test was run.
{{{
  cd ~/hypertable/0.9.0.11
  cp ~/src/html/doc/tests/rsclient/hypertable.cfg conf
  ./bin/start-all-servers.sh local
  cd ~/build/hypertable/debug/src/cc/Tools/rsclient
  make test; make test; make test; make test; make test; make test; make test; make test; make test; make test
}}}

==4. AOL Test: metadata split==
This test can be found at `motherlode000:/home/doug/tests/aol-metadata-split`.  It is essentially the same test as the AOL basic test, except with the following lines added to the Hypertable config file:
{{{

}}}
The test consists of the following files:

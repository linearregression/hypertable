#summary Performance Benchmark of Hypertable on KFS vs. HDFS

==The Data (AOL Query log)==
Here's an example of what the AOL query log data looks like:
{{{
AnonID  Query   ItemRank        ClickURL
1636218 www.airtime500.com      2       http://www.airtime500.com

[...]
}}}

The row key used was the AnonID. The Query, !ItemRank, and ClickURL, columns were inserted into a table that was created with the following HQL command:
{{{
CREATE TABLE "query-log" (
Query,
ItemRank,
ClickURL
);
}}}

The query log was sorted by timestamp. Each line of the query log could generate from 1 to 3 inserts, depending on how many column values were present. After the entire log was inserted, the table contained 75,274,825 cells. On average, the size of each row key was about 7 bytes and the size of each value inserted was 15 bytes.

==Machine Profile==

  * 1 1.8GHz Dual-core Opteron Processor 2210
  * 4 GB RAM
  * 4 7200 RPM SATA drives (mounted JBOD)

==Insert Test==
*_
NOTE: The Hypertable Range Servers write their commit log into HDFS, however HDFS currently does not support a sync (or flush) operation.  The insert rate may drop some  once sync is implemented and called after each commit log write._*

Eight machines (motherlode001-motherlode008) were used to run both HDFS (version 0.16.4) and Hypertable. The Hypertable master and Hyperspace (Chubby) were run on motherlode001. HDFS was configured to use only three of the four available drives on each machine and was configured with 3-way replication. The log was sorted by timestamp and split into 5 pieces (a.tsv, b.tsv, c.tsv, d.tsv, e.tsv. Two separate machines (motherlode000 and motherlode009) were used to run insert clients. The following HQL commands were started more-or-less simultaneously:

{{{
motherlode000:
LOAD DATA INFILE ROW_KEY_COLUMN=AnonID 'a-no-timestamps.tsv' INTO TABLE "query-log";
LOAD DATA INFILE ROW_KEY_COLUMN=AnonID 'b-no-timestamps.tsv' INTO TABLE "query-log";

motherlode009:
LOAD DATA INFILE ROW_KEY_COLUMN=AnonID 'c-no-timestamps.tsv' INTO TABLE "query-log";
LOAD DATA INFILE ROW_KEY_COLUMN=AnonID 'd-no-timestamps.tsv' INTO TABLE "query-log";

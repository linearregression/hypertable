#summary Instructions on how to get Hypertable up and running with Hadoop

==Starting the Servers==

===Step 1===

Install and start Hadoop.

===Step 2===

Make sure you have extended attributes enabled on the partition that holds the root of the Hyperspace directory tree.  This will be the same disk volume that holds the installation (e.g. ~/hypertable), unless you configured Hyperspace explicitly to point to somewhere else.  This is not necessary on the mac, but is in general on Linux systems.  To enable extended attributes on Linux, you need to add the user_xattr property to the relevant file systems in your /etc/fstab file. For example:
{{{
   /dev/hda3     /home     ext3     defaults,user_xattr     1 2
}}}
You can then remount the affected partitions as follows:
{{{
   $ mount -o remount /home
}}}


==Step 3==

Create the directory `/hypertable` in HDFS and make it writeable by all.

{{{
$ hadoop fs -mkdir /hypertable
$ hadoop fs -chmod 777 /hypertable
}}}

==Step 4==

Edit the config file conf/hypertable.cfg  Change the following property to point to the Hadoop filesystem that got up and running in step 1 (assuming hdfs://motherlode000:9000):
{{{
HdfsBroker.fs.default.name=hdfs://motherlode001:9000
}}}
Change the following two properties to point to the location of the Hypertable Master and Hyperspace (assuming motherlode001):
{{{
Hyperspace.Master.Host=motherlode001
Hypertable.Master.Host=motherlode001
}}}


==Step 5==

Start the Master and Hyperspace

{{{
ssh motherlode001 ~/hypertable/bin/start-master.sh hadoop
}}}

==Step 6==

Start the Range Servers.  Add all of the names of the machines that will be running range servers to the file conf/slaves relative to the installation directory.  Here's what an example one looks like:
{{{
$ cat conf/slaves 
motherlode001
motherlode002
motherlode003
motherlode004
motherlode005
motherlode006
motherlode007
motherlode008
}}}

This slaves file, along with the entire installation should be pushed out to all of the machines using something like rsync.  Once you've done this, you can launch all of the range servers with the following command (assuming installation dir is ~/hypertable on all of the machines):
{{{
./bin/slaves.sh ~/hypertable/bin/start-range-server.sh hadoop
}}}

Now you sould be able to run the `~/hypertable/bin/hypertable` HQL command interpreter and start playing around.


=Stopping the System=

Execute the following commands to stop all of the servers:
{{{
ssh motherlode001 ~/hypertable/bin/kill-servers.sh
./bin/slaves.sh ~/hypertable/bin/kill-servers.sh
}}}

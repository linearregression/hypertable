#summary This page describes the procedure for recovering from Hyperspace master failure in a distributed Hyperspace setup.

Say you have three Hyperspace replicas running on {{{host[1-3].somedomain.com}}} respectively and the master replica which was running on {{{host2}}} fails:

  # Run {{{cap stop}}} to stop the cluster
  # Login to one of the functioning servers which was running Hyperspace replica (in this case {{{host1}}} or {{{host3}}}) and run:
{{{    
/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/bin/db_hotbackup -h <$HYPERTABLE_INSTALL_DIR>/hyperspace/ -b hyperspace_snapshot
tar -zcvf hyperspace_snapshot
}}}
  # Identify the new machine you want to use as a Hyperspace replica (say {{{host4}}})
  # Delete contents of {{{host4:/<$HYPERTABLE_INSTALL_DIR>/hyperspace}}}. Copy {{{hyperspace_snapshot.tgz}}} to {{{host4:/<$HYPERTABLE_INSTALL_DIR>/hyperspace/}}} & extract.
  # Modify your hypertable config file to remove {{{host2}}} and add {{{host4}}} under the property {{{Hyperspace.Replica.Host}}} .
  # Modify hypertable config file to replace {{{host2}}} with {{{host4}}} in case it was set as {{{Hypertable.Master.Host}}}
  # Modify the Capfile list of hyperspace servers to replace {{{host2}}} with {{{host4}}} (and master server in case {{{host2}}} was the Hypertable master as well).
  # Run {{{cap dist}}} to distribute the new config file through the cluster
  # Run {{{cap start}}}

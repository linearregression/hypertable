#summary Design document for GUID generator in Hypertable

= Introduction =

This document describes the design of a GUID (Globally Unique ID) generator built into Hypertable.  The goal is to add and API to Hypertable that will return a GUID that is guaranteed to be unique in the face of machine failures.

= Proposal =

We propose adding the following APIs to the Table class (with equivalents in the Thrift API):

{{{
int64_t next_guid(uint32_t timeout_ms = 0);
int64_t next_guid_async(ResultCallback *cb, uint32_t timeout_ms = 0);
}}}

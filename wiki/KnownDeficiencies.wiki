  * !RangeServer recovery is not implemented.  

This is the *highest* priority issue and is actively being worked on now.  It will be available soon in an upcoming "dot release"
  * System is not endian-neutral.  It will not work properly in a heterogeneous environment.
  * Hyperspace is currently single server.  This needs to be made highly available by distributing it and implementing a consensus protocol or something equivalent.
  * The Master is currently single server.  The current plan is to allow for hot standbys that monitor the master's lock in Hyperspace and grab it when it becomes available.  This is implemented, but has not been tried or tested.

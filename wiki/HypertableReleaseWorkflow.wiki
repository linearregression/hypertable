#summary Release maintainer's notes
The example shown here is to upgrade from 0.9.0.0-alpha to 0.9.0.1-alpha. Adapt accordingly.

  # Prepare for next release
    * Update the `CHANGES` file with the list of changes for the release
    * Modify the `CMakeLists.txt` file to include the new version number
    * Modify build.xml file to include the new version number
    * Rename the `lib/hypertable-$VERSION.jar` file to reflect the new release version

  # Test all changes in the 'next' branch
    * First get all changes into 'next'
    * Make sure the version number is correct (e.g. 0.9.0.1 here) in the top-level CMakeLists.txt
    * Make sure 'next' is identical to 'master', do a `git pull . master`
    * Make sure tests are passing in the 'next' branch

  # Pull the changes from 'next' into 'master'
  {{{
  git checkout master
  git pull . next
  }}}
  # Tag the release:
{{{
git tag -a v0.9.0.1
}}}
  Note, -a or -s is required for "git describe" used by the version mechanism in the build system)
  # Push the changes to official repository:
{{{
git push # optionally with an origin name
git push --tags # optionally with an origin name
}}}
  # Create release tarball:
{{{
git archive --format=tar --prefix=hypertable-0.9.0.1-alpha/ v0.9.0.1 | gzip -9 > /tmp/hypertable-0.9.0.1-alpha-src.tar.gz
}}}
   Note: gzip compress better than bzip2 for hypertable source, go figure; the trailing / in the prefix is important.
  # Upload the tarball to the google code download area:  http://code.google.com/p/hypertable/downloads/list
  # Update website: change wordings if necessary. But more importantly edit the download.html, so that hypertable-0.9.0.0-alpha-src.tar.gz is changed to hypertable-0.9.0.1-alpha-src.tar.gz  You'll also need to change the release date on all of the web pages with a bash command like the following:
{{{
sed -i.bak 's/February 4/February 7/g' *.html
}}}
  # Send a note to the mailing lists (hypertable-...)

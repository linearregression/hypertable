#summary Release maintainer's notes
The example shown here is to upgrade from 0.9.0.0-alpha to 0.9.0.1-alpha. Adapt accordingly.

  # Make sure all the changes for the release is in the master branch.
  # Make sure tests are passing.
  # Tag the release:
{{{
git tag v0.9.0.1
}}}
  # Push the changes to official repository:
{{{
git push # optionally with an origin name
}}}
  # Create release tarball:
{{{
git archive --format=tar v0.9.0.1 | gzip -9 > /tmp/hypertable-0.9.0.1-alpha-src.tar.gz
}}}
   Note: gzip compress better than bzip2 for hypertable source, go figure.
  # Commit release tarball to google code: 
    * Checkout release branch if you haven't:
{{{
svn co https://hypertable.googlecode.com/svn/tags release-ht
}}}
    * Make a new release branch:
{{{
cd release-ht
mkdir v0.9.0.1
mv /tmp/hypertable-0.9.0.1-alpha-src.tar.gz v0.9.0.1/
svn add v0.9.0.1
svn commit # take a break for coffee or something here
}}}
  # Update website: change wordings if necessary. But more importantly edit the download.html, so that download.php?v=0.9.0.0-alpha is changed to download.php?v=0.9.0.1-alpha
  # Send a note to the mailing lists (hypertable-...)

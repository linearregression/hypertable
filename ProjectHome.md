This project is for the design and implementation of a high performance, scalable, distributed storage and processing system for structured and unstructured data.  It is designed to manage the storage and processing of information on a large cluster of commodity servers, providing resilience to machine and component failures.  Data is represented in the system as a multi-dimensional table of information. The data in a table can be transformed and organized at high speed by performing computations in parallel, pushing them to where the data is physically stored.  The main project site for Hypertable is http://www.hypertable.com/
